A Dream&nbsp;&nbsp;↩
</span>

I’ve never really been into entrepreneurship (👈 I was so bad at spelling it that auto-correct had to help me out). But like many of you, I want to be my own boss. It all starts with one great idea that solves a problem or brings something new to the table, creating space for you in society and generating wealth that brings freedom.

You might be feeling the same way, thinking about starting a business. You might be ready to:

- Pick an idea
- Build a team
- Do research to check if it’s viable
- Take quick action
- Commit fully to the process

This is a common misconception that many young entrepreneurs fall into—spending time on things that don’t matter.

A Reality Check&nbsp;&nbsp;↩
</span>
A recent report from July 11 this year shows that **only 20% of startups survive more than five years, and just 8% make it past ten years.** According to the Institute of Business Value and Oxford Economics, 90% of Indian startups fail within their first five years.

Here’s a look at some reasons why startups fail:

- 23% fail due to a weak founding team
- 19% are outpaced by competition
- 42% of startups fail because there’s simply no market need for their product.

You can’t go back and redo things. The only time we truly have is now. Your current thoughts will shape your future actions, but the future is unpredictable and influenced by many factors.

A Hard Truth&nbsp;&nbsp;↩
</span>
Take Kodak, once a leader in photography, which failed to adapt to digital trends and lost its customers. Or Blockbuster, which ignored the rise of streaming services and watched its empire fall apart.

Building your own startup is challenging. It’s crucial to align your dreams with your current reality, tasks, and abilities.

Before you dive in, take a moment for a reality check. Get a second opinion on your thoughts about starting this entrepreneurial journey. Read through to the end and take notes; this might be the best investment of your time before you end up in the same boat as the 90% who fail.

So, what does it take to be an entrepreneur, and what makes a startup successful?

**N: Vision and Drive&nbsp;&nbsp;**
</span>

You dream of a world where your startup stands out and brings change. But bright mornings can quickly fade into the daily grind, and doubts may cloud your vision. You might find yourself questioning your abilities and the very core of your dream.

It’s a wake-up call: entrepreneurship demands resilience, clarity, and a strong commitment to your vision.

> “People should pursue what they're passionate about. That will make them happier than pretty much anything else.” — Elon Musk

Remember, your vision is the lighthouse in the fog.

So ask yourself:

- Do you have a clear vision of what you’re building?
- Are you open to seeking mentorship?
- Can you channel your energy into bringing your vision to life? What tools do you have at your disposal?

**E: Financial Stability&nbsp;&nbsp;**
</span>


Financial worries can haunt even the most ambitious dreamers. Standing at a crossroads with your budget sheet can feel overwhelming. Instead of being a roadmap, it can feel like a burden. The fear of financial instability looms large, threatening to snuff out your entrepreneurial spark before it even ignites.

Many startups fail because of cash flow issues.

> “Entrepreneurship isn’t just about chasing ideas; it’s about balancing dreams with dollars.”

Statistics show that countless startups buckle under financial pressure. Having financial stability empowers your vision. It lets you take risks, innovate, and thrive.

If you don’t have financial privilege, you may need to put your career on the line.

The key question is:

Do I have the financial backing to take these risks?

> “Business opportunities are like buses; there’s always another one coming.” — Richard Branson

This perspective highlights the importance of preparation. The financial groundwork you lay today can open doors tomorrow.

Having a solid financial plan is essential—not just for survival, but for thriving. Understand your financial resources and budget wisely.

**S: Network and Support&nbsp;&nbsp;**
</span>

Building a business can feel like sailing a vast ocean alone, but it doesn’t have to be that way.

> “Your network is not just a list of contacts; it’s a lifeline.” — Jagadesh Ronanki

Entrepreneurs with strong networks are more likely to succeed. It’s not just about who you know; it’s about building genuine relationships. Seek out those who inspire, challenge, and hold you accountable. In this journey, connections are your greatest asset.

You’ll likely need a Chief Financial Officer (CFO) to manage your finances. Finding the right one can be tough and building a team that aligns with your goals is crucial. Networking can help make this happen.

Remember, every conversation is a chance for growth. Don’t hesitate to reach out—many are eager to share their wisdom just as you seek to learn.

Closing yourself off from connections will only keep opportunities out of reach.

**W: Knowledge and Expertise&nbsp;&nbsp;**
</span>


> “Your most unhappy customers are your greatest source of learning.” — Bill Gates

When you first enter an industry, it can feel like being a child in a library full of complex books. The knowledge gaps can be daunting, and the fear of not measuring up can be paralyzing.

Remember, expertise isn’t something you’re born with; it’s built through curiosity, learning, and adaptability. “In entrepreneurship, knowledge isn’t static; it’s a dynamic force. You must be ready to face challenges and adjust.”

The world is filled with lessons waiting to be learned—make them your allies.

**Balance: Resilience and Adaptability&nbsp;&nbsp;**
</span>


Now we reach the toughest part—maintaining a positive mindset in the face of challenges.

> “The greatest discovery of all time is that a person can change his future by merely changing his attitude.” — Oprah Winfrey

Every entrepreneur faces setbacks, but how we respond defines our journey. You might bounce back quickly or slowly, but sustaining progress isn’t just about recovering; it’s about adapting and evolving.

Each failure teaches invaluable lessons, refining your approach and strengthening your resolve.

The most successful entrepreneurs aren’t those who never fail; they are the ones who learn, rise, and adjust.

Are you ready to adapt to change, seek feedback, and turn obstacles into opportunities, even if it means starting over countless times?

Your path as an entrepreneur is rarely straightforward, but every twist and turn can lead you closer to your goals.

A Few&nbsp;&nbsp;↩
</span>
I don’t want to disappoint you, but the choice is yours. You can choose to chase the dream or stick with what’s comfortable. Sure, there are stories like those of Airbnb, which began as a simple idea to help cover rent, or WhatsApp, which started with little more than a vision and a lot of perseverance. They stumbled upon success seemingly by chance, but those are the exceptions, not the rule.

A Mental Toll&nbsp;&nbsp;↩
</span>
The entrepreneurial journey is riddled with challenges. Individuals with an entrepreneurial spirit often find themselves grappling with significant emotional and mental hurdles. The pressure of leadership can feel isolating; founders frequently struggle to confide in employees or investors, and many battle feelings of imposter syndrome, questioning their worth and capability.

Mental health issues, like anxiety and depression, can creep in, affecting both personal relationships and overall well-being. Team dynamics can become strained, and the emotional toll of managing diverse personalities is no small feat.

Then there’s the relentless work-life imbalance. Long hours often bleed into weekends and holidays, leaving little room for personal connections. The weight of decision fatigue—having to make countless choices every day—can be overwhelming, leading to burnout and exhaustion.

And let’s not forget the external pressures: the constant demands to meet revenue targets and growth expectations can be suffocating, amplifying stress and anxiety.
