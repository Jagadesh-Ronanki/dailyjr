### 2. Send Your Text

Write your text message in the format you want:

- Bold text by typing `bt[Your bold text here]`.
- Bullet points by typing `Items[Point 1, Point 2, Point 3]`.

### 3. Receive Beautiful Images

## Features

WritersPic makes text formatting easy and fun by turning your words into high-quality images that are perfect for sharing. Here's what you can do with WritersPic:

### 3. Instant Sharing

## How It Works

WritersPic processes the text you send to the bot using LaTeX, a powerful typesetting system. It then generates an image based on your formatting, ensuring that your text looks professional and clean.

### Example Text Formats

Here’s how you can format your text to get the desired output:

- **Headings**: Type `[Heading] Your Heading Here`
- **Bold Text**: Type `bt[Your bold text here]`
- **Bullet Points**: Type `Items[Point 1, Point 2, Point 3]`

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues, here are a few things to check:

- Make sure you're using the correct formatting syntax (e.g., `bt[]` for bold text, `Items[]` for bullet points).
- If the bot doesn't respond, ensure you have a stable internet connection.
